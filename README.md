Data were collected in 2014 and 2015 by Isak Ladegaard. Andrew Tsai, Robert Bradley, and Isak Ladegaard collaborated on data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis.

The original dataset had xxx observations.

We aggregated the data to the file uploaded here. We aggregated the data to each day for each type of product and for each country.  

Here's an example:

On the day of 11/4/2014, there are many transactions for oxycodone pills in the US.  We take all the transactions for oxycodone pills in the US for 11/4/14 and aggregate them into one average price and a total quantity transacted that day.  We do this for all types of products, for each day and each country.
